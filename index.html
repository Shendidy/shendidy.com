              <p>With a BSc in civil engineering, and as projects manager for the past 12 years in one of the most challenging and dynamic industries in the world and in the most robust city, Dubai, I'm determined to live my life now doing what I enjoy the most and start a career in the software development. Bringing with me all life and professional skills  gained over the years, along with what I learnt at Makers academy and before that as a hobbyist software developer.</p><div id="projects"></div><br /><br />

              <h2 class="linksTitle">Skills</h2>
              <dl>
                <dt>Self Teaching:</dt>
                <dd>- Since childhood I was so attracted to software development, and started with Basic on my commodore 64 back in the 80s. Later on in university I started reading books about C, then C++. As well as working for free during a summer holiday in a hardware company fixing desktop systems from scratch depending on the specifications set by our clients and installing all required software and operating system.</dd>
                <dd>- Later on I started learning Visual Studio and wrote few programs using Visual C#, 2 of which are <a href="http://shendidy.com/software/textguardlite.html" target="_blank">Text Guard lite</a>, and <a href="http://www.shendidy.com/software/vapulator.html" target="_blank">Vapulator</a>.</dd>
                <dd>- I also taught myself a bit of flash and developed a very simple and basic online game [Maya in the Park](http://www.shendidy.com/games/mip.html), then my biggest challenge was when I wanted to start a free online lottery site where members can fill their free tickets weekly, connect with other players and earn more tickets, check their current and previous tickets, check any winnings, claiming their prize if any, and many other options. To do that I researched and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MYSQL. From the moment I had the website idea to launch it took me 9 months of learning and implementation during my free time of a 6 days a week very demanding job. Check it out at <a href="https://www.bigbof.com" target="_blank">bigBOF.com</a>.</dd>
                <dt>Problem Solving:</dt>
                <dd>- I believe that without problems, there will be no jobs for us out there, so they never scare me, they just tease my brain, and the harder the challenge, the more I get excited and commit to finding the best solution.</dd>
                <dd>- With this mindset, I managed to develop a stable, calm, and analytical approach to solving problems I face on my day to day life, or at work, asking the basic questions of:</dd>
                <dd>
                  <ul>
                    <li>How they started (or what is the final requirement).</li>
                    <li>What are the possible solutions and what are their consequences.</li>
                    <li>Which one/s is/are the most relevant to the case I have in hand.</li>
                    <li>What are the costs of each possible solution (money, time, memory, clarity of code, ease of use and integration with other parts of the project).</li>
                    <li>Decide and start implementing the solution, while testing it regularly during implementation.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring the performance after implementing a solution and ensuring it's inline with our requirements/expectations.</li>
                  </ul>
                </dd>
                <dt>Agile, scrum, and Pairing techniques:</dt>
                <dd>- At Makers, I practiced a lot of pairing and agile approach to deliver a project in accordance with the client's requirements, on time, clean and DRY, and fully tested.</dd>
                <dd>- Working in teams, we'd regularly (twice a day) do stand-ups to discuss briefly where each pair stand with their tasks and any blockage they're facing and help each other solving them. Then plan our works before our next stand-up.</dd>
                <dd>- Then every other day we'd have a retro to look at the bigger picture and analyse where the project stands from the plan put in place at the start phase and eliminate any deviation from it.</dd>

                <dd>- Next to coding, my other childhood obsession was with flying, and I managed to make my dream come true in 2009 when I got my PPL (Private Pilot Licence) allowing me to fly my family and friends in single piston engine airplanes.</dd>

                <dd>One of the quietest and calmest experiences you can ever have is diving 40 feet below water and merging with the beautiful nature and creatures living in harmony far away from all the pollution generated by humans.
